# Earthquake Data Explorer

A data visualization app for 2021 through 2022 South Carolina Earthquake Swarm.  The application will present a map 
where each event is plotted.  You can hover the mouse pointer over a marker to display some information about the 
earthquake event at that location.  By default, when the app is launched, it displays the events starting on December 
2021 until the current date.  You can filter the events displayed by using the date filter and/or the earthquake 
magnitude filter.  To display even more information about a particular event, click on the event's marker to select it, 
then choose a graph plot type from the dropdown.  The graph plot will be displayed below the events map.

This application was developed with Python, Dash library for creating low-code web data applications, and the Plotly 
library for creating the map and table visualizations.

# Installation

### Render.com

There is an instance of the application available on render.com at https://dash-earthquake-data-app.onrender.com.
Be patient.  It will take a few minutes for the environment to spin up and start the application.  Also, the app will
run slowly at times especially when rendering the maps and graphs; Plus the app has not been optimized in this version.
